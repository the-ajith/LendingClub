# Landing Club Case Study
> Lending Club specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile. The objective is to pinpoint applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses. This case study aims to achieve this goal through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the provided dataset. In another words the aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## General Information

The objective is to pinpoint applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses. This case study aims to achieve this goal through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the provided dataset.

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business.
On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.

## Conclusions

Term Length: Given that applicants opting for 60-month loans are more likely to default, the company should consider evaluating the risk associated with longer-term loans and potentially limiting the maximum term or adjusting interest rates accordingly.

Experience and Default Probability: Loan applicants with ten or more years of experience are more likely to default. This suggests that experience alone may not be a reliable indicator of creditworthiness. The company should use a more comprehensive credit scoring system that factors in other risk-related attributes.

Debt Consolidation Risk: Since debt consolidation is the category with the maximum number of loans and high default rates, the company should carefully evaluate applicants seeking debt consolidation loans and potentially adjust interest rates or offer financial counseling services.

Housing Status and Default Risk: Applicants living in rented or mortgaged houses are more likely to default. This information can be considered in the underwriting process to assess housing stability and its impact on repayment ability.

Low Annual Income: Applicants with annual incomes less than $40,000 have a higher likelihood of defaulting. The company should consider offering financial education resources or setting maximum loan amounts based on income levels to ensure affordability for borrowers.
